# Web Development Project
This is my first website build with MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). 

# How To Run The Web

In the project directory, you can run:

### [](https://github.com/whongam/project-showcase/tree/main/frontend#npm-start)`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)  to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
